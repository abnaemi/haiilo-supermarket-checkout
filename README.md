Description:Implement a simplified supermarket checkout system. The cart can contain any number and combination of available items, in any order. Additionally the checkout system should support weekly offers, where an offer defines a number of items that are discounted when bought together. For example: one apple costs 0.30€, but 2 apples are offered at 0.45€. These offers should be applied automatically during checkout.
